# TODO


- Hero Upgrade
    - Add +new hero option to hero bar
    - Add auto scroll back to hero
- Add to size in form
    - Keep size for "large/medium/etc..."
    - Add "MEASUREMENTS" as it's own field
- Get and add the text for "Keeping it clean" in the details section


- Add note about free shipping in US

- UPDATE DUMB ASS LOADING BAR or swap it out for spinning wheel....

- Add some UI when asdding to cart to encourage immediate checkout. Modal perhaps.

- Separate the creation of a new category from creation of a new product. It is confusing flow. 
- Would mean two steps for erin she'd have to go create the category ( I could link to it in product form) THEN create product, but would alleviate some potential issues like accidental category creation

- Speaking of accidental category creation - allow her to remove categories (unless they are the two main ones... vintage and handmade) but make the modal two step to really make sure she wants to do it.

- Add a HIDE button for adminButtons to swap out inventory with hide in tags

- If no photos show up in a given category or filter display a message

- PurchaseSuccess view could use some love
    - Add "other items" could be just random for now...

- Show total by cart icon

- Add ability to filter products by "series".

- Drag and Drop order change for store items
- Move firebase functions to backend
- Rotate Credentials
- Archive products when deleted (requires new backend route...)
- Check different browsers. Style in safari for admin is janky 
    - Specifically in hero


- commisions page?:
    - "See something you like, but not the right size? Need new drapes for your kitchen? New vintage fabric rug? etc..."
