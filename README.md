A React E-Commerce website for Erin Dawn Campbell
Fully functional shopping cart and product gallery with admin backend for non-coding crud capability for handling inventory.

Currently selling at [Grandmother Goods](https://www.gmother.com/) 


# TODO

- !! make sure when user refreshes to update state for buttons
- If no photos show up in a given category or filter display a message
- add option to clear filter in shop
- Let user know when shop is filtered

- Update Key Change for mobile friendly version
- Drag and Drop order change for store items
- Move firebase functions to backend
- Rotate Credentials
- Archive products when deleted (requires new backend route...)
- Do we need an edit series form? 
- Check different browsers. Style in safari for admin is janky 
    - Specifically in hero
