A React E-Commerce website for Erin Dawn Campbell
Fully functional shopping cart and product gallery with admin backend for non-coding crud capability for handling inventory.

Currently selling at [Grandmother Goods](https://www.gmother.com/) 


# TODO

1. Make items purchaseable
2. Make it easy for Erin to add/remove products, and update the website photos. 
3. Make sure when it is editable that it does not allow her to break website by removing hero photos, or other crucial style photos. 
4. Add photos to session or store locally somehow to avoid constant calls to firebase on refresh
5. When #4 is implemented will need to update the allPhotos state as well to match the new state.
