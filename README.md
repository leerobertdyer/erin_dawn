A React E-Commerce website for my wife's clothing business

Will focus on availability of products first

Adding authenticated administation site for her to use

Possibly extending use into api calls to [Grandmother Goods](https://www.gmother.com/) where she is currently selling with her partner Steph. This way when she updates her website it will automatically take down any products elsewhere. 

Will also handle payments through stripe square or paypal...

Backend in go, coming soooooon...
