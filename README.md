A React E-Commerce website for Erin Dawn Campbell
Fully functional shopping cart and product gallery with admin backend for non-coding crud capability for handling inventory.

Currently selling at [Grandmother Goods](https://www.gmother.com/) 


# TODO

## MUST HAVE

- Send email/text notification when sale is made

- Add note about free shipping in US

- Add a HIDE button for adminButtons to swap out inventory with hide in tags

- Show total by cart icon

- Rotate Credentials



## NICE TO HAVE

- Email Collection of some kind for repeat customers. Perhaps give them 10% off next purchase?

- Admin panel still looks ameture could use some style updates

- Hero Upgrade
    - Add +new hero option to hero bar
    - Add auto scroll back to hero

- CHECK SMALLER PHONES - Esp the buttons on edit key photos should be clickable. Prob add mb- to every main page view

- Fix glitch where old photo shows after editing and then re-editing on hero at least...

- UPDATE DUMB ASS LOADING BAR or swap it out for spinning wheel....

- Add some UI when asdding to cart to encourage immediate checkout. Modal perhaps.

- Separate the creation of a new category from creation of a new product. It is confusing flow. 
    This Would mean two steps for erin she'd have to go create the category ( I could link to it in product form) THEN create product, but would alleviate some potential issues like accidental category creation

- Speaking of accidental category creation - allow her to remove categories (unless they are the two main ones... vintage and handmade) but make the modal two step to really make sure she wants to do it.

- If no photos show up in a given category or filter display a message

- PurchaseSuccess view could use some love
    - Add "other items" could be just random for now...

- Add ability to filter products by "series".

- Drag and Drop order change for store items


- Check different browsers. Style in safari for admin is janky 
    - Specifically in hero

## Security issues

- Move firebase functions to backend

- Archive products when deleted (requires new backend route...)

## Ideas for later:

- commisions page?:
    - "See something you like, but not the right size? Need new drapes for your kitchen? New vintage fabric rug? etc..."
