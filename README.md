# TODO

# Cart Updates
- Add note about free shipping in US
- Show total by cart icon
- Add some UI when asdding to cart to encourage immediate checkout. Modal perhaps.

# Security
- Rotate Credentials 

# Marketing
- Email Collection of some kind for repeat customers. 
- Discounts for signup: 10% off next purchase. Not sure how to implement that

# Hero/Model updates
- Add +new model photo option to hero bar
- Make card flip to random model photo (random hero)


- Speaking of accidental category creation - allow her to remove categories (unless they are the two main ones... vintage and handmade) but make the modal two step to really make sure she wants to do it.

- If no photos show up in a given category or filter display a message

- PurchaseSuccess view could use some love

- Add ability to filter products by "series".

- Check different browsers. Style in safari for admin is janky 
    - Specifically in hero

## Ideas for later:

- commisions page?:
    - "See something you like, but not the right size? Need new drapes for your kitchen? New vintage fabric rug? etc..."
