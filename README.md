# TODO

## MUST HAVE

- Add note about free shipping in US

- Show total by cart icon

- Rotate Credentials

- 


## NICE TO HAVE


- Email Collection of some kind for repeat customers. Perhaps give them 10% off next purchase?

- Admin panel still looks ameture could use some style updates

- Hero Upgrade
    - Add +new hero option to hero bar
    - Add auto scroll back to hero
    - Make card flip to random model photo (random hero)

- Add some UI when asdding to cart to encourage immediate checkout. Modal perhaps.

- Speaking of accidental category creation - allow her to remove categories (unless they are the two main ones... vintage and handmade) but make the modal two step to really make sure she wants to do it.

- If no photos show up in a given category or filter display a message

- PurchaseSuccess view could use some love
    - Add "other items" could be just random for now...

- Add ability to filter products by "series".

- Drag and Drop order change for store items MOBILE NEEDS HELP

- Check different browsers. Style in safari for admin is janky 
    - Specifically in hero

## Security issues

- Move firebase functions to backend

- Archive products when deleted (requires new backend route...)

## Ideas for later:

- commisions page?:
    - "See something you like, but not the right size? Need new drapes for your kitchen? New vintage fabric rug? etc..."
